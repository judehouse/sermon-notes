# A Family Devotions Note Template Parents Can Use Each Week

Parents often ask the same question after church: how do we carry this into our home this week?

A simple family devotions note template gives you a practical bridge.

## The 6-part family devotion template

Use this structure:

1. **Sunday Text**: main sermon passage
2. **One Big Truth**: sentence children can understand
3. **One Question**: discussion starter for the table
4. **One Story**: personal or biblical example
5. **One Practice**: concrete family action this week
6. **One Prayer**: short prayer line to repeat daily

This keeps devotions clear and repeatable.

## Example from James 1:5

- Sunday Text: James 1:5
- One Big Truth: God gives wisdom when we ask in faith.
- One Question: Where do you need wisdom this week?
- One Story: A school decision where prayer mattered.
- One Practice: Pray for wisdom before school each morning.
- One Prayer: "Lord, give us wisdom that trusts You."

Simple language helps children engage without confusion.

## Keep family devotions short

Aim for 8 to 12 minutes:

- Read
- Discuss
- Pray

Long sessions can discourage consistency, especially with younger children.

## Connect to your sermon notes

After service, pull one section from your sermon notes into your family template. This creates continuity between gathered worship and home discipleship.

Parents do not need to invent new curriculum every week.

## FAQ

### What if my kids are different ages?

Use one shared big truth and adjust follow-up questions by age level.

### How many nights per week should we do family devotions?

Start with two consistent nights. Add frequency later if sustainable.

### Should we cover many verses or one verse?

One focused passage is usually better for understanding and retention.

## Final takeaway

Family discipleship grows through consistency, not complexity. A repeatable devotion template helps parents move sermon truth into ordinary weekly life.
