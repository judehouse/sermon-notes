# 10 Common Sermon Note Mistakes and How to Fix Them

Sermon notes often fail for predictable reasons. The good news is that each problem has a simple fix.

## 1) Trying to write every sentence

**Fix:** Capture structure, not transcript. Focus on passage, main idea, and key movements.

## 2) No consistent format

**Fix:** Use one template every week with fixed headings.

## 3) Skipping Scripture references

**Fix:** Always write references first. They are your retrieval anchors.

## 4) No post-sermon cleanup

**Fix:** Spend five minutes adding missing references and rewriting the main point.

## 5) No application section

**Fix:** End every note with one measurable action for the week.

## 6) Over-highlighting everything

**Fix:** Reserve highlight colors for two categories only, such as action and core doctrine.

## 7) Inconsistent titles and tags

**Fix:** Use a standard naming format and fixed tag categories.

## 8) Never reviewing notes

**Fix:** Schedule one 10-minute midweek review session.

## 9) Capturing facts without reflection

**Fix:** Add one question: "Where does this confront my life right now?"

## 10) Using too many tools

**Fix:** Keep one primary note system. Tool-switching destroys consistency.

## Quick reset plan

If your current note habit feels broken, reset with this:

1. Start one simple template
2. Keep one review reminder
3. Keep one weekly action line

Do this for four weeks before changing anything else.

## FAQ

### What is the biggest sermon note mistake?

Not revisiting notes. Capture without review produces low long-term value.

### How often should I change my note system?

Rarely. Change only when a clear problem persists for several weeks.

### Are handwritten notes less effective than digital notes?

Both can work. Effectiveness depends on structure and review, not medium.

## Final takeaway

Most sermon note issues are operational, not spiritual. Correct the mechanics, and your notes become clearer, more useful, and easier to apply.
