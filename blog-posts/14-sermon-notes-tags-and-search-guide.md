# Sermon Notes Tags and Search Guide: Build a Retrieval-First System

Most people do not lose notes. They lose access to notes. Tagging and search solve that problem when done simply.

## The core tagging model

Use four required tags on every sermon note:

- `book:` Bible book
- `series:` sermon series name
- `theme:` doctrine or life theme
- `date:` sermon date

Optional tags:

- `speaker:`
- `church:`
- `people:`

Required tags keep retrieval stable. Optional tags add context when needed.

## Naming conventions that scale

Use lowercase and singular forms for consistency:

- `theme: prayer` not `theme: prayers`
- `theme: suffering` not `theme: hard-times`

Tag fragmentation weakens search quality.

## Search patterns that save time

Use layered queries:

- `theme: prayer + book: psalms`
- `series: james + theme: speech`
- `speaker: pastor-name + theme: gospel`

If your tags are standardized, these queries surface relevant notes quickly.

## Monthly tag hygiene checklist

Once a month:

1. Merge duplicates
2. Remove vague tags
3. Rename inconsistent formats
4. Update old notes with missing required tags

A clean taxonomy is an ongoing discipline.

## Avoid these tagging mistakes

- Creating a new tag for every sermon
- Using emotional tags only, such as `encouraging`
- Mixing formats like `Prayer` and `prayer`
- Forgetting series tags

A small controlled vocabulary always beats creative chaos.

## FAQ

### How many tags should each sermon note have?

Usually four to six tags is ideal.

### Should tags match website categories?

Yes when possible. Alignment between internal notes and published categories improves content planning.

### What is better: folders or tags?

Use both, but prioritize tags for retrieval across multiple dimensions.

## Final takeaway

Searchable notes require intentional tagging. Keep categories small, names consistent, and monthly cleanup routine. Retrieval is what turns note-taking into long-term wisdom.
