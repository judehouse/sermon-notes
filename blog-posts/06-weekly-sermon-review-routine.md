# The Weekly Sermon Review Routine That Builds Real Retention

Many Christians hear strong teaching on Sunday and forget most of it by midweek. The issue is not desire. The issue is process.

A short weekly review routine turns sermon notes into ongoing formation.

## The 15-minute weekly review plan

Schedule one fixed slot each week. Keep it short and repeatable.

1. **Read the passage again** (3 minutes)
2. **Scan your notes** (4 minutes)
3. **Write a three-line summary** (3 minutes)
4. **Choose one obedience step** (3 minutes)
5. **Pray over your response** (2 minutes)

This rhythm creates continuity between Sunday hearing and weekday living.

## What to include in your summary

Your summary should answer:

- What did this text reveal about God?
- What did it expose in me?
- What action is clear now?

If you cannot answer these, your notes need a clearer main idea.

## How to measure whether review is working

Track three simple indicators:

- You can recall the main sermon point on demand.
- You can name one concrete life response.
- You can connect this week to previous themes.

Retention is not trivia. Retention is usable truth.

## Build in accountability

To increase follow-through:

- Share one takeaway with a friend or spouse.
- Bring one summary line to small group.
- Add your weekly action to a prayer list.

Externalizing insight helps internalize it.

## Make review easier with searchable notes

If your notes are digital and tagged by series and theme, weekly review becomes faster. Search lets you revisit related sermons and see patterns God is reinforcing.

A retrieval-friendly system supports a review-friendly life.

## FAQ

### What day should I review my sermon notes?

Choose the same day each week. Consistency matters more than timing. Midweek is usually ideal.

### How long should weekly review take?

Ten to fifteen minutes is enough for most people.

### What if I missed church this week?

Review your latest note anyway. Keep the rhythm and add one new reflection from personal Scripture reading.

## Final takeaway

A weekly sermon review routine does not require extra discipline as much as a better system. Keep it short, scheduled, and actionable, and your notes will start shaping daily life.
